# Multi-threaded-Proxy-Server
Designed a Proxy server to handle multiple client requests, with or without storing the response as Cache. Enhanced the requests using semaphores, locks, and an HTTP parser. Used LRU cache, Linked Lists, and different structs to achieve Multithreaded behavior and to avoid RACE condition.
